## Use Cases (by priority)
**Use Case 1** Subscriber needs to know todayâ€™s menu.

The only way today is that admin needs to post menu of the day on the whatsapp group. This requires repeated typing, and is additional work for management. After lot of such messages on the group, the menu of the day needs to scrolled and searched for.
  
**Use Case 2** Subscriber needs to inform kitchen admin that s/he is wants to cancel the food delivery for that particular day.

The only way for the subscriber to do that is by posting a message on whatsapp group. In a group of such large numbers, it is possible that the admin may miss this message. This causes food wastage and frustration for kitchen management.

**Use Case 3** Subscriber wants to request modification of menu or cancel a modification already requested.

This is the most painful scenario for the kitchen staff. The subscribers post such customizations on the whatsapp group and the admin actually needs to keep track of such ad hoc requests. E.g. one subscriber needs more rice, another needs no chapattis at all. This is highly error prone and cumbersome since whatsapp is not designed for such work at all.
