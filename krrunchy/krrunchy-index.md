Food delivery application for my local community

## Purpose
In todayâ€™s world, may of us live away from our homes for work and many are dependent on catering services for food. My local community kitchen provides food delivery service to the to local households at nominal charges with the intention of providing food security. The organization manages the cooking, packaging and delivery of food and they offer customization options on a per subscriber basis to avoid food wastage. In order to communicate with the subscribers, the admins of this community kitchen use social networking apps, predominantly Whatsapp and at times make phone calls. If there is an application that can replace whatsapp, then it will make life very convenient for the kitchen staff and the subscribers.

**Current scale of operations**
 
 Kitchen staff interacts with a subscriber base of more than 100 households per locality within a city. There could be 10 or more such localities per city. This is inefficient and error prone way to manage food delivery and there is a need for a small app to ease this pain area.


## Proposed Solution
A microservices based web application that can be accessed by Web and Mobile UI clients. The registration of the subscribers will be controlled by the kitchen admin and they will be authenticated by a third party provider. The subscribers will able to 
1. Check daily and weekly menus
2. Check blackout dates (when food will not be delivered)
3. Request customization or cancellation
4. Share feedback

Admins will he able to 
1. Publish menus
2. Publish blackout dates
3. See customizations on a per subscriber basis 
4. Read feedback
5. Get statistics of the subscriber base

We propose an easy interface that will be convenient for users who are not very used to using such applications as well - e.g. senior citiens.
