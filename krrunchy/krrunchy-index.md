# Krrunchy
Food delivery application for my local community

## Purpose
 My local community kitchen provides food delivery service to the to local households at nominal charges with the intention of providing food security. The organization manages the cooking, packaging and delivery of food and they offer customization options on a per subscriber basis to avoid food wastage. 

**Current challenge**
In order to communicate with the subscribers, the admins of this community kitchen use social networking apps, predominantly Whatsapp and at times make phone calls. If there is an application that can replace whatsapp, then it will make life very convenient for the kitchen staff and the subscribers, since this tool is an inefficient and error prone way to manage food delivery and keep track of messages of every user.

**Current scale of operations**
 
 The kitchen staff interacts with a subscriber base of more than 100 households per locality within a city. There could be 10 or more such localities per city. 


## Proposed Solution
A microservices based web application that can be accessed by Web and Mobile UI clients. The registration of the subscribers will be controlled by the system administrator and they will be authenticated by a third party service e.g. Google. The clients should have a simple interface that will be convenient for users of all sections of the society - e.g. senior citizens.
